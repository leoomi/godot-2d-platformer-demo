# godot-2d-platformer-demo
A simple 2D platformer demo build with Godot.

## Demo
I implemented this to get a better grasp of Godot. I wanted to implement a few movement features mainly and Godot's native nodes were handy for that.
Godot's CharacterBody2D implements a lot of movement and collision behavior and the template script was a great starting point. 
Here are a few things I wanted to implement and experiment with:
- State machine and multiple movement states
- Short hops and long jump similar to Super Smash Bros. with a jump squat animation
- Fast fall after jump peak
- Wall jumps
- One-way platforms and platform drops (basically for free with Godot's collision shapes)

## To do
- Ledge grabbing and get up
- Roll/dash
- Attack animations
